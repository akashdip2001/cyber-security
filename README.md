### Types of Cyber Attacks  
Cyber attackers exploit systems through technical or human vulnerabilities. Below are common types of cyber attacks with illustrative examples:  

#### 1. **Denial of Service (DoS) Attack**  
- **Definition:** Causes a complete or partial system outage by overwhelming it with traffic or crashing it.  
- **Example:** A "billion laugh attack," where an XML file recursively expands to overload a server.  

#### 2. **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attack**  
- **Definition:** Similar to DoS but launched from multiple sources (botnets).  
- **Example:** Overloading a web server with millions of simultaneous page requests.  

#### 3. **Phishing Attack**  
- **Definition:** Fraudulent messages mimic trusted sources to steal information or deliver malware.  
- **Example:** Fake emails with malicious links or attachments trick users into downloading malware.  

#### 4. **Spear Phishing Attack**  
- **Definition:** Highly targeted phishing attack based on detailed research about the victim.  
- **Example:** Impersonating a bank representative to steal account details or transfer funds.  

#### 5. **Malware**  
- **Definition:** Malicious software that harms systems or steals data.  
- **Example:**  
  - **Keyloggers:** Capture keystrokes to steal sensitive information.  
  - **Ransomware:** Encrypts files and demands payment for decryption.  

#### 6. **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack**  
- **Definition:** Hackers intercept communications between a client and a server.  
- **Example:** Fake public Wi-Fi hotspots used to capture login credentials or insert ads.  

#### 7. **Domain Name System (DNS) Attack**  
- **Definition:** Exploits DNS, a core internet protocol for domain-to-IP resolution.  
- **Example:** The 2016 Dyn DNS attack caused widespread outages in the US.  

#### 8. **Structured Query Language (SQL) Injection**  
- **Definition:** Inserting malicious code into SQL queries to manipulate databases.  
- **Example:** UK teenagers hacked TalkTalk in 2015, stealing customer data.
